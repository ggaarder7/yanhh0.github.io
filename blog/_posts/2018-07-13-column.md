title: 70 Characters per Line
tags: [ starred, cs, emacs ]

I used to use auto-align, but then turned to 80-column sometimes I
need to view my file under console.

Now I'm switching to 70-column because of CVS, which will add tags
like spaces, '+' and '-' when comparing, reminded by a comment on SO.

Configuring this in Emacs:

```elisp
(setq-default fill-column 70)
```
