I just forgot how to diff in git style, and by the way made a
research. The origin is [Linus' Mail]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_reprints/2005-05-15-linus-git.md %}).

From this post I found the answer `diff -Nru`. What the options mean?
Man:

```
       -N, --new-file
              treat absent files as empty
       -r, --recursive
              recursively compare any subdirectories found
       -u, -U NUM, --unified[=NUM]
              output NUM (default 3) lines of unified context
```

Only with `-u` diff outputs the style I want with '+' '-' and '@'.
