Last year I got a recording 'Selected MS105' in the classical guitar
group. Today I came across this piece in my playlist again, wondering
at the name 'Marziale in E Major, MS 105': what's 'marziale' for? I
made a search on the Internet but got nothing. I then asked in a
classical guitar group in WeChat, and IShowber said it's the same as
'marzo', but he didn't explain when I asked him 'where did you find
that'.
