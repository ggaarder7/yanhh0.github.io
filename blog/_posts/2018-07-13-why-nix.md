title: Why *nix for programming?
tags: [ starred, nix ]

Just now a friend of mine decided to download Anaconda, and I
suggested programming under \*nix instead of Windows, according to my
own experience. I can name four problems: encoding, CLI, back-slash
for path separator and new-line. But the very problem that push me to
\*nix is the speed issue: I use many \*nix programs like Python, GCC,
Emacs etc. They runs extremely slows since *they are designed for
\*nix, not Win*.
