- The 'Render HTML messages as text' feature of Claws Mail is so cool!
- Last month Y.Q.Y. pointed out that I often say something like
  '<somebody> looks like <another>'. Maybe because I miss the past -
  so am I insecure of my present environment?
- (Recalling) I began listening to classical music at Liszt's La
  Campanella, as a result of a search 'the hardest piano pieces' on my
  ninth grade. It was played by Li Yundi, and the next pieces I
  listened is Yundi's Beethoven album, including Path√©tique, Moonlight
  and Appassionata.
