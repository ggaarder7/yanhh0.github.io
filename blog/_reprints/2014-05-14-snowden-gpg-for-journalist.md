Before Laura Poitras brought Glenn Greenwald into the story about
former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Greenwald
received messages from a mysterious contact calling himself
Cincinnatus. The source urged Greenwald to learn how to protect his
e-mail with encryption so he could receive sensitive information.

Cincinnatus reportedly even went so far as to send a video tutorial to
Greenwald, walking him through the necessary steps to set up the added
security measures. But Greenwald [didn't bother to get with the
program][1] until after he was in Hong Kong and in deep discussions
with Snowden, at which point he realized he may have missed out on the
opportunity for another scoop by not following up with Cincinnatus.

The twist? Cincinnatus turned out to be Snowden. After Greenwald
e-mailed Cincinnatus to let him know he'd finally set up encryption,
Snowden revealed he was behind the correspondence all along.

"By the way, that Cincinnatus you just emailed, that’s me,” Greenwald
recalled Snowden telling him in "No Place to Hide," his new memoir.

And now anyone can watch the video Snowden sent to Greenwald. Dan
Froomkin, who works with Greenwald at the Pierre Omidyar media startup
The Intercept, [tweeted][2] out a link to the video Wednesday
morning. It appears to be the [video tutorial][3] Greenwald described
in a Rolling Stone interview published last December.

The video, which clocks in at just over 12 minutes, was posted to
Vimeo a year ago by someone using the pseudonym "anon108." It explains
how to set up encryption on a Windows machine, using stick figures and
screenshots that reveal the creator was using Tor and other tools to
cover his tracks. The video is narrated by a digitally disguised voice
whose speech patterns sound similar to those of Snowden in subsequent
interviews and live-streamed appearances.

Interestingly, the NSA is directly referenced in the video: A [parody
version][4] of the agency's logo created by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation is used as a stand-in for government surveillance.

Froomkin and Greenwald did not immediately respond to an inquiry
asking whether Snowden actually created the video himself. Earlier
this year, Snowden joined the board of the [Freedom of the Press
Foundation][5], which counts Greenwald and Poitras among its founding
members and is currently running a crowd-funding campaign to support
encryption tools for journalists.

*Correction: This post previously contained an update that erroneously
stated that Greenwald confirmed Snowden had authored the
video. Greenwald said he could not confirm the authorship of the
video.*
