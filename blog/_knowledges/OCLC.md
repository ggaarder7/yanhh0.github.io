OCLC, currently incorporated as OCLC Online Computer Library Center,
Incorporated,[3] is an American nonprofit cooperative organization
"dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's
information and reducing information costs".[4] It was founded in 1967
as the Ohio College Library Center. OCLC and its member libraries
cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public
access catalog (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees
that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200 million
annually as of 2016).[1] OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal
Classification system.
