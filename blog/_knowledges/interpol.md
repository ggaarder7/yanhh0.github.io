The International Criminal Police Organization (French: Organisation
internationale de police criminelle; ICPO-INTERPOL), more commonly
known as Interpol, is the international organization that facilitates
international police cooperation. It was established as the
International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC) in 1923; it chose
INTERPOL as its telegraphic address in 1946, and made it its common
name in 1956.[4]

INTERPOL has an annual budget of around €113 million, most of which is
provided through annual contributions by its membership of police
forces in 192 countries (as of 2017). In 2013, the INTERPOL General
Secretariat employed a staff of 756, representing 100 member
countries.[1] Its current Secretary-General is Jürgen Stock, the
former deputy head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office. He
replaced Ronald Noble, a former United States Under Secretary of the
Treasury for Enforcement, who stepped down in November 2014 after
serving 14 years.[5] Interpol's current President is Meng Hongwei,
Deputy Minister of Public Security of China.

To keep INTERPOL as politically neutral as possible, its charter
forbids it, at least in theory, from undertaking interventions or
activities of a political, military, religious, or racial nature or
involving itself in disputes over such matters.[6] Its work focuses
primarily on public safety and battling transnational crimes against
humanity, child pornography, computer crime, cybercrime, drug
trafficking, environmental crime, genocide, human trafficking, illicit
drug production[7], copyright infringement, illicit traffic in works
of art, intellectual property crime, money laundering, organized
crime, corruption, terrorism, war crimes, weapons smuggling, and
white-collar crime.

## History

In the first part of the 20th century, several efforts were taken to
formalize international police cooperation, but they initially
failed.[8] Among these efforts were the First International Criminal
Police Congress in Monaco in 1914, and the International Police
Conference in New York in 1922. The Monaco Congress failed because it
was organized by legal experts and political officials, not by police
professionals, while the New York Conference failed to attract
international attention.

In 1923, a new initiative was taken at the International Criminal
Police Congress in Vienna, where the International Criminal Police
Commission (ICPC) was successfully founded as the direct forerunner of
INTERPOL. Founding members included police officials from Austria,
Germany, Belgium, Poland, China, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, and
Yugoslavia.[9] The United Kingdom joined in 1928.[10] The United
States did not join Interpol until 1938, although a US police officer
unofficially attended the 1923 congress.[11]

Following Anschluss in 1938, the organization fell under the control
of Nazi Germany, and the Commission's headquarters were eventually
moved to Berlin in 1942.[12] Most members withdrew their support
during this period.[9] From 1938 to 1945, the presidents of the ICPC
included Otto Steinhäusl, Reinhard Heydrich, Arthur Nebe, and Ernst
Kaltenbrunner. All were generals in the SS, and Kaltenbrunner was the
highest ranking SS officer executed after the Nuremberg Trials.

After the end of World War II in 1945, the organization was revived as
the International Criminal Police Organization by officials from
Belgium, France, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. Its new
headquarters were established in Saint-Cloud, a suburb of Paris. They
remained there until 1989, when they were moved to their present
location in Lyon.

Until the 1980s, INTERPOL did not intervene in the prosecution of Nazi
war criminals in accordance with Article 3 of its Charter, which
prohibited intervention in "political" matters.[13]

In July 2010, former INTERPOL President Jackie Selebi was found guilty
of corruption by the South African High Court in Johannesburg for
accepting bribes worth €156,000 from a drug trafficker.[14] After
being charged in January 2008, Selebi resigned as president of
INTERPOL and was put on extended leave as National Police Commissioner
of South Africa.[15] He was temporarily replaced by Arturo Herrera
Verdugo, the National Commissioner of Investigations Police of Chile
and former vice president for the American Zone, who remained acting
president until October 2008 and the appointment of Khoo Boon Hui.[16]

On 8 November 2012, the 81st General Assembly closed with the election
of Deputy Central Director of the French Judicial Police Mireille
Ballestrazzi as the first female president of the
organization.[17][18]

In November 2016, Meng Hongwei, a politician from the People's
Republic of China, was elected president at the 85th Interpol General
Assembly, and will serve in this capacity until 2020.[19]

## Constitution

The role of INTERPOL is defined by the general provisions of its
constitution.[2]

Article 2 states that its role is:

1. To ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between
   all criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws
   existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the
   Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
2. To establish and develop all institutions likely to contribute
   effectively to the prevention and suppression of ordinary law
   crimes.

Article 3 states:
- It is strictly forbidden for the Organization to undertake any
  intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or
  racial character.

## Methodology

Contrary to the way it is frequently portrayed in popular culture,
Interpol is not a supranational law enforcement agency and has no
agents who are able to make arrests.[20] Instead, it is an
international organization that functions as a network of criminal law
enforcement agencies from different countries. The organization thus
functions as an administrative liaison among the law enforcement
agencies of the member countries, providing communications and
database assistance, assisted via the central headquarters in Lyon,
France.[21]

Interpol's collaborative form of cooperation is useful when fighting
international crime because language, cultural and bureaucratic
differences can make it difficult for police officials from different
nations to work together. For example, if ICE and FBI special agents
track a terrorist to Italy, they may not know whom to contact in the
Polizia di Stato, if the Carabinieri have jurisdiction over some
aspect of the case, or who in the Italian government must be notified
of the ICE/FBI's involvement. ICE and the FBI can contact the Interpol
National Central Bureau in Italy, which would act as a liaison between
the United States and Italian law enforcement agencies.

Interpol's databases at the Lyon headquarters can assist law
enforcement in fighting international crime.[20] While national
agencies have their own extensive crime databases, the information
rarely extends beyond one nation's borders. Interpol’s databases can
track criminals and crime trends around the world, specifically by
means of collections of fingerprints and face photos, lists of wanted
persons, DNA samples, and travel documents. Interpol's lost and stolen
travel document database alone contains more than 12 million
records. Officials at the headquarters also analyze these data and
release information on crime trends to the member countries.

An encrypted Internet-based worldwide communications network allows
Interpol agents and member countries to contact each other at any
time. Known as I-24/7, the network offers constant access to
Interpol's databases.[20] While the National Central Bureaus are the
primary access sites to the network, some member countries have
expanded it to key areas such as airports and border access
points. Member countries can also access each other's criminal
databases via the I-24/7 system.

Interpol issued 13,637 notices in 2013, of which 8,857 were Red
Notices, compared to 4,596 in 2008 and 2,037 in 2003. As of 2013,
there are currently 52,880 valid notices in circulation.[1]

In the event of an international disaster, terrorist attack, or
assassination, Interpol can send an Incident Response Team (IRT). IRTs
can offer a range of expertise and database access to assist with
victim identification, suspect identification, and the dissemination
of information to other nations' law enforcement agencies. In
addition, at the request of local authorities, they can act as a
central command and logistics operation to coordinate other law
enforcement agencies involved in a case. Such teams were deployed
eight times in 2013.[1] Interpol began issuing its own travel
documents in 2009 with hopes that nations would remove visa
requirements for individuals traveling for Interpol business, thereby
improving response times.[22] In September 2017, the organization
voted to accept Palestine and the Solomon Islands as members.[23]

## Finances

In 2013, Interpol's operating income was €78 million, of which 68
percent was contributed by member countries, mostly in the form of
statutory contributions (67 percent) and 26 percent came from
externally funded projects, private foundations and commercial
enterprises. Financial income and reimbursements made up the other six
percent of the total.[1] With the goal of enhancing the collaboration
between Interpol and the private sector to support Interpol's
missions, the Interpol Foundation for a Safer World was created
in 2013. Although legally independent of Interpol, the relationship
between the two is close enough for Interpol's president to obtain in
2015 the departure of HSBC CEO from the foundation board after the
Swiss Leaks allegations[24].

From 2004 to 2010, Interpol's external auditors was the French Court
of Audit.[25][26] In November 2010, the Court of Audit was replaced by
the Office of the Auditor General of Norway for a three-year term with
an option for a further three years.[27][28]

## Criticism

Despite its politically neutral stance, some have criticized the
agency for its role in arrests that critics contend were politically
motivated. In the year 2008, the office of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees pointed to the problem of arrests of refugees on the
request of Interpol[29] in connection with politically motivated
charges. In their declaration, adopted in Oslo (2010),[30] Monaco
(2012),[31] Istanbul (2013),[32] and Baku (2014),[33] the OSCE
Parliamentary Assembly criticized some OSCE member States for their
abuse of mechanisms of the international investigation and urged them
to support the reform of Interpol in order to avoid politically
motivated prosecution. The Istanbul Declaration of the OSCE cited
specific cases of such prosecution, including those of the Russian
activist Petr Silaev, financier William Browder, businessman Ilya
Katsnelson, Belorussian politician Ales Michalevic, and Ukrainian
politician Bohdan Danylyshyn. The resolution of the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Council of Europe of 31 January 2014 criticizes the
mechanisms of operation of the Commission for the Control of
Interpol's files, in particular, non-adversarial procedures and unjust
decisions.[34][35] In 2014, PACE adopted a decision to thoroughly
analyse the problem of the abuse of Interpol and to compile a special
report on this matter.[36] In May 2015, within the framework of the
preparation of the report, the PACE Committee on Legal Affairs and
Human Rights organized a hearing, during which both representatives of
NGOs and Interpol had the opportunity to speak.[37]

Organizations, such as the Open Dialog Foundation,[38] Fair Trials
International,[39] Centre for Peace Studies,[40] International
Consortium of Investigative Journalists[41] indicate that
non-democratic states use Interpol in order to harass opposition
politicians, journalists, human rights activists and
businessmen. According to them, countries that frequently abuse the
Interpol system include: China,[42] Russia, Iran, Turkey, Kazakhstan,
Belarus, Tunisia.[38][39][41]

The Open Dialog Foundation's report analysed 44 high-profile political
cases, which went through the Interpol system.[38] A number of persons
who have been granted refugee status in the EU and the US, including:
Russian businessman Andrey Borodin,[43] Chechen Arbi Bugaev,[44] the
Kazakh opposition politician Mukhtar Ablyazov[45] and his associate
Artur Trofimov,[46] a journalist from Sri Lanka Chandima Withana[47]
continue to remain on the public Interpol list. Some of the refugees
remain on the list of Interpol even after courts have refused to
extradite them to a non-democratic state (for example, Pavel
Zabelin,[48] a witness in the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Alexandr
Pavlov,[49] former security chief of the Kazakh oppositionist
Ablyazov).

Interpol has recognized some requests to include persons on the wanted
list as politically motivated, e.g., Indonesian activist Benny Wenda,
Georgian politician Givi Targamadze,[50] ex-president of Georgia
Mikheil Saakashvili,[51] ex-president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya
Rosales;[52] these persons have been removed from the wanted
list. However, in most cases, Interpol removes a "red notice" against
refugees only after an authoritarian state closes a criminal case or
declares amnesty (for example, the cases of Russian activists, and
political refugees: Petr Silaev, Denis Solopov, Aleksey Makarov, and
Turkish sociologist Pinar Selek).[53][54][55][56] The election of Meng
Hongwei as president and Alexander Prokopchuk, a Russian, as vice
president of Interpol for Europe drew criticism in western media and
raised fears of Interpol accepting politically motivated requests from
China and Russia.[57][58][59]

Refugees who are included in the list of Interpol can be arrested when
crossing the border.[39] The procedure for filing an appeal with
Interpol is a long and complex one. For example, the Venezuelan
journalist Patricia Poleo and a colleague of Kazakh activist Ablyazov,
Tatiana Paraskevich, who were granted refugee status, sought to
overturn the politically motivated request for as long as one and a
half years, and six months, respectively.[60][61][62]

In 2013, Interpol was criticized over its multimillion-dollar deals
with such private sector bodies as FIFA, Philip Morris, and the
pharmaceutical industry. The criticism was mainly about the lack of
transparency and potential conflicts of interest such as
Codentify.[63][64][65][66][67][68] After the 2015 FIFA scandal, the
organization has severed ties with all the private-sector bodies that
evoked such criticism, and has adopted a new and transparent financing
framework.

In 2016, Taiwan criticized Interpol for turning down Taiwan's
application to join the General Assembly as an observer.[69] The
United States supports Taiwan's participation, and the U.S. Congress
passed legislation directing the Secretary of State to develop a
strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan.[70]

According to Stockholm Center for Freedom's report that was issued on
September 2017, Turkey has weaponized Interpol mechanisms to hunt down
legitimate critics and opponents in violation of Interpol's own
constitution. The report lists abuse cases where not only arrest
warrants but also revocation of travel documents and passports were
used by Turkey as persecution tool against critics and opponents. The
harassment campaign targeted foreign companies as well.[71]

**2014 Russian intervention in Ukraine**

On 25 July 2014, despite Interpol's Constitution prohibiting them from
undertaking any intervention or activities of a political or military
nature,[72] the Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary leader Dmytro
Yarosh was placed on Interpol's international wanted list at the
request of Russian authorities,[73] which made him the only person
wanted internationally after the beginning of the conflict between
Ukraine and Russia in 2014. For a long time, Interpol refused to place
former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych on the wanted list as a
suspect in the mass killing of protesters during Euromaidan.[74][75]
Yanukovych was eventually placed on the wanted list on 12 January
2015.[76] However, on 16 July 2015, after an intervention of Joseph
Hage Aaronson LLP, the British law firm hired by the former Ukrainian
President Yanukovych, the international arrest warrant against the
former president of Ukraine was suspended pending further review.[77]
In December 2014, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) liquidated a
sabotage and reconnaissance group that was led by a former agent of
the Ukrainian Bureau of Interpol that also has family relations in the
Ukrainian counter-intelligence agencies.[78] This year[clarification
needed], Russia has made attempts to place on the Interpol wanted list
Ukrainian politician Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Ukrainian civic activist
Pavel Ushevets, subject to criminal persecution in Russia following
his pro-Ukrainian art performance in Moscow.[79]

According to The Open Dialog Foundation, Russia and other former
Soviet republics like Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan frequently
misuse the Interpol system. The foundation's reports cite 44
politically motivated cases which have passed through the Interpol
system. Of these, 18 cases originated in Russia, 10 in Kazakhstan and
five in Belarus.[80]

## The reform of Interpol mechanisms

From 1–3 July 2015, Interpol organized a session of the Working Group
on the Processing of Information, which was formed specifically in
order to verify the mechanisms of information processing. The Working
Group heard the recommendations of civil society as regards the reform
of the international investigation system and promised to take them
into account, in light of possible obstruction or refusal to file
crime reports nationally.[81]

Human rights organization, The Open Dialog Foundation, recommended
that Interpol, in particular: create mechanism for the protection of
rights of people having international refugee status; initiate closer
cooperation of the Commission for the Control of Files with human
rights NGO and experts on asylum and extradition; enforce sanctions
for violations of Interpol's rules; strengthen cooperation with NGOs,
the UN, OSCE, the PACE and the European Parliament.[82]

Fair Trials International proposed to create effective remedies for
individuals who are wanted under a Red Notice on unfair charges; to
penalize nations which frequently abuse the Interpol system; to ensure
more transparency of Interpol's work.[83]

The Centre for Peace Studies also created recommendations for
Interpol, in particular to delete Red Notices and Diffusions for
people who were granted refugee status according to 1951 Refugee
Convention issued by their countries of origin, and to establish an
independent body to review Red Notices on regular basis.[40]

## Emblem

The current emblem of Interpol was adopted in 1950 and includes the
following elements:[4]

- the globe indicates worldwide activity
- the olive branches represent peace
- the sword represents police action
- the scales signify justice
