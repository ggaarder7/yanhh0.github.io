Ludwig van Beethoven wrote his 32 piano sonatas between 1795
and 1822. Although originally not intended to be a meaningful whole,
as a set they compose one of the most important collections of works
in the history of music.[1] Hans von Bülow called them "The New
Testament" of music (Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier
being "The Old Testament").[2] 

## List of sonatas

### Early Sonatas

Beethoven's early sonatas were highly influenced by those of Haydn and
Mozart. Even so, he began to find new ways of composing his
sonatas. His Piano Sonatas No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11 were four
movements long, which was very uncommon in his time.

Opus 2: Three Piano Sonatas (1795)

- No. 1: Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor
- No. 2: Piano Sonata No. 2 in A major
- No. 3: Piano Sonata No. 3 in C major

Opus 7: Piano Sonata No. 4 in E-flat major ("Grand Sonata") (1797)

Opus 10: Three Piano Sonatas (1798)

- No. 1: Piano Sonata No. 5 in C minor
- No. 2: Piano Sonata No. 6 in F major
- No. 3: Piano Sonata No. 7 in D major

Opus 13: Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor ("Pathétique") (1798)

Opus 14: Two Piano Sonatas (1799)

- No. 1: Piano Sonata No. 9 in E major (Also arranged by the composer
  for String Quartet in F major (H 34) in 1801)
- No. 2: Piano Sonata No. 10 in G major

Opus 22: Piano Sonata No. 11 in B-flat major (1800)

### Middle Sonatas

After he wrote his first 13 sonatas (up to Op. 28), he wrote to Wenzel
Krumpholz, "From now on, I'm going to take a new path." Beethoven's
sonatas from this period are very different from his earlier ones. His
experimentation in modifications to the common sonata form of Haydn
and Mozart became more daring, as did the depth of expression. Most
Romantic period sonatas were highly influenced by those of
Beethoven. After 1804, Beethoven ceased publishing sonatas in sets and
only composed them as a single opus. It is unclear why he did so.

Opus 26: Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major ("Funeral March") (1801)

Opus 27: Two Piano Sonatas (1801)

  fantasia' ("Moonlight")

Opus 28: Piano Sonata No. 15 in D major ("Pastoral") (1801)

Opus 31: Three Piano Sonatas (1802)

- No. 1: Piano Sonata No. 16 in G major
- No. 2: Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor ("Tempest")
- No. 3: Piano Sonata No. 18 in E-flat major ("The Hunt")

Opus 81a: Piano Sonata No. 26 in E-flat major ("Les adieux/Das
Lebewohl") (1810)

Opus 90: Piano Sonata No. 27 in E minor (1814)

### Late Sonatas

Beethoven's late sonatas were some of his most difficult works and
some of today's most difficult repertoire. Yet again, his music found
a new path, often incorporating fugal technique and displaying radical
departure from conventional sonata form. The Hammerklavier was deemed
to be Beethoven's most difficult sonata yet. In fact, it was
considered unplayable until almost 15 years later, when Liszt played
it in a concert.

Opus 101: Piano Sonata No. 28 in A major (1816)

Opus 106: Piano Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major ("Hammerklavier") (1818)

Opus 109: Piano Sonata No. 30 in E major (1820)

Opus 110: Piano Sonata No. 31 in A-flat major (1821)

Opus 111: Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor (1822)
