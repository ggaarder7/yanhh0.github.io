```
Verse one D
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn-up town
No post code envy
pre-chorus
D
But every song's like gold teeth,Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
Cadd9 G
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams.
D
But everybody's like cristal, maybach,diamonds on your time piece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
Cadd9 G
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.
Chorus
D
And we'll never be royals..It doesn't run in our blood,
Cadd9
that kind of lux just ain't for us.
G
We crave a different kind of buzz.
D
Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen Bee
Cadd9
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.
G
Let me live that fantasy.
verse two
D
My friends and I we've cracked the code.We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,we didn't come from money.
pre-chorus
D
But every song's like gold teeth,grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom.
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
Cadd9 G
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams.
D
But everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your time piece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
Cadd9 G
We don't care we aren't caught up in your love affair
repeat chorus
Bridge
D
Oooh ooooh ohhh
Cadd9
We're bigger than we ever dreamed,
G
and I'm in love with being queen.
D
Oooooh ooooh ohhhhh
Cadd9
life is game without a care
G
We aren't caught up in your love affair.
repeat chorus
