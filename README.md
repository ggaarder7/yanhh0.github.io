SVM:
- how to get `b`?????
- Quadratic optimization
- Classification of images
- image segmentation
- recognize hand-written characters
- mathematically prove that SVM also holds on higher dimensions (than
  two)
- mathematically prove that '`w*xi - b >= 1` if and only if the point
  lies in the margin (so does `w*xi -b <= -1`)' also holds on higher
  dimensions (than two)
- SVC
- SVR
- Kernel trick

New words:
- tradeoff
- sufficiently
- Systolic BP?

- pattern recognition
- what model the curve in `2018-06-06_20-33-21.png` right is: special
  plot regarding to the chosen kernel function
- plot like `2018-06-06_20-33-21.png` right

- QR Code

Quotes in [SVM without
Tears][med.nyu.edu/chibi/sites/default/files/chibi/Final.pdf]:
- This tutorial is both *modest (it does not invent anything new)*

 [SVM without
 Tears][med.nyu.edu/chibi/sites/default/files/chibi/Final.pdf]:
- L2-norm is a typical way to measure length of a vector; *other
  methods to measure length also exist.* ??
